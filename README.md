**Troubleshooting**: 
AttributeError: module 'urllib' has no attribute 'urlopen'
**Solution**: 
import urllib.request
urllib.request.urlopen(...)

2. Objectives
There are two incorrect thingsâ€¦
(1) Ratio is always 1
(2) The price of each stock is always the same as its bid_price.

3. Making changes to client3.py
(1) **getDataPoint**
